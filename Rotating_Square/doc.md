# Rotating Square Example 
In a seven-segment LED display, a square pattern can be created by enabling the a, b, f, 
and g segments or the c, d, e, and g segments. We want to design a circuit that circulates
the square patterns in the four-digit seven-segment LED display. The circuit should have an input,
en, which enables or pauses the circulation, and an input, cw, which specifies the direction 
(i.e., clockwise or counterclockwise) of the circulation.

Design the circuit and verify its operation on the prototyping board. Make sure that the
circulation rate is slow enough for visual inspection
